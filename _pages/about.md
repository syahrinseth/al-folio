Hi, my name is `Syahrin` and I'm a `Full-Stack Web Developer` based in Malaysia. An introvert who loves to solve problems, build websites and products, definitely a computer is involved. I love to take pictures of anything I see interesting and post it on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@syahrinseth).

I'm also a creator of [Smart Dhikr App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syahrinseth.thedhikrapp) where this help Muslims to monitor their dhikr habits.
