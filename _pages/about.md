Hi, my name is `Syahrin` and I'm a `Full-Stack Web Developer` based in Malaysia. An introvert who loves to solve problems, build websites and products, definitely a computer is involved. I love to take pictures of anything I see interesting and post it on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@syahrinseth).

I'm also a creator of [Smart Dhikr App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syahrinseth.thedhikrapp) where this help Muslims to monitor their dhikr habits.


Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
